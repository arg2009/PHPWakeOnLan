```

## Usage:

```php
<?php

use \Diegonz\PHPWakeOnLan\WakeOnLan;

$macAddresses = [
    '00:1B:2C:1C:DF:22',
    '01:1C:2C:1C:DF:13',
];

try {
    $wol = new WakeOnLan($macAddresses);
    print_r($wol->wake());
} catch (Exception $e) {
    var_dump($e->getMessage());
}
```

Example output:

```bash
Array
(
    [00:1B:2C:1C:DF:22] => Array
        (
            [result]     => OK
            [message]    => Magic packet sent to 00:1B:2C:1C:DF:22 through 255.255.255.255
            [bytes_sent] => 102
        )

    [01:1C:2C:1C:DF:13] => Array
        (
            [result]     => OK
            [message]    => Magic packet sent to 01:1C:2C:1C:DF:13 through 255.255.255.255
